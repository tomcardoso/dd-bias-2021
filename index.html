					<p>A sentence of two years or longer lands you in federal prison. We have a <strong>massive</strong> overincarceration problem for Indigenous and Black people.</p>

					<h3>Risk assessments</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Standardized tests.</li>
						<li>Designed to measure an inmate’s risk to the public and odds of being rehabilitated.</li>
						<li>Everywhere in corrections. Murderers, fraudsters, etc.: everyone gets one.</li>
						<li>Federally, used to classify, treat, and parole the 12-14,000 inmates in custody each year.</li>
						<li><span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>But: Evaluating risk is tricky. Tons of room for bias.</strong></span></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Though there are many risk tools and types of scores in federal prison, two are most important: <strong>security classification</strong> and <strong>reintegration potential score</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Issues in assessment</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Cultural bias</li>
						<li>Highly subjective to the assessor</li>
						<li>Tough to interpret results</li>
						<li>Take years to design an assessment, and then years to find out if it works</li>
						<li>Over time, tools become less effective</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What we found</h3>
					<p><em>After controlling for variables like age, gender, the severity of inmates’ offences and past contact with the criminal justice system…</em></p>
					<p>Black men are roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>24%</strong></span> more likely than white men to end up in maximum security at admission.</p>
					<p>Indigenous men are roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>30%</strong></span> more likely to have the worst reintegration score at any point.</p>
					<p>Both are <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>less likely</strong></span> to reoffend after controlling for reintegration scores.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Even worse for Indigenous women</h3>
					<p>They’re roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>64%</strong></span> more likely than white women to end up in maximum security at admission.</p>
					<p>Also roughly <span class="highlight-burgundy"><strong>40%</strong></span> more likely to receive the worst reintegration score.</p>
					<p>And, as an internal report we later obtained made clear: the government had warned Correctional Service Canada <strong>in 2004</strong> about bias in its risk scores.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How did this come together?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>More than 90 interviews with sources developed over a nine-month period</li>
						<li>Hundreds of pages of inmate records, dozens of academic studies</li>
						<li>One big freedom of information request, for a massive CSC database of 50,000 inmates. 750,000 rows in all. <em>(If you'd like to learn about filing “data FOIs,” check out <a href="https://github.com/tomcardoso/foi-data-journalism">my other talk</a>.)</em></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What about the analysis process?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Started simple, summarizing the data.</li>
						<li>Quickly realized that if I wanted to quantify the impact of race alone, I needed to somehow account for variations in age, gender, offence severity, etc.</li>
						<li>Enter: statistical modelling! Multivariate logistic regressions, specifically.</li>
						<li>All done using R, a statistical programming language, and The Globe’s data journalism template, <strong><a href="https://github.com/globeandmail/startr">startr</a></strong>. <em>(And a <strong>lot</strong> of help from statisticians and academics.)</em></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Response</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Published first story on a Saturday morning. By Monday afternoon, the House of Commons public safety committee had announced a study of systemic racism in prison risk assessments.</li>
						<li>Prime Minister acknowledged findings a few days later.</li>
						<li>Lawyers using our reporting at parole hearings.</li>
						<li>Just two weeks ago: Class-action human rights lawsuit filed against the federal government on behalf of tens of thousands of inmates.</em></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Takeaways</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul style="font-size: 0.8em;">
						<li><strong>File big-picture, ambitious data FOIs.</strong> Most won’t work out… but a few will.</li>
						<li><strong>Don’t be afraid to pivot.</strong> I did!</li>
						<li><strong>Experiment with new techniques whenever you can.</strong> I learned how to model data for this story.</li>
						<li><strong>Try to disprove your own findings.</strong> Especially on big stories.</li>
						<li><strong>Write a methodology story.</strong> Be transparent about your process and caveats. Most people won’t read it, but the ones who do will appreciate it.</li>
						<li><strong>Data is just one tool.</strong> Never underestimate the importance of traditional reporting. You still need to find documents, build sources and pick up the phone.</li>
