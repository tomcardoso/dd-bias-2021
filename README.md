This is the repository for a talk on investigating systemic bias in Canada's federal prison risk assessments. The slides can be found here: https://tomcardoso.github.io/dd-bias-2021/

This talk was originally given at the virtual [Data Driven 2021](http://humberstorylab.ca/events/data-driven-2021/) conference on January 29, 2021. Here's a brief description:

> In late October, The Globe and Mail published Bias Behind Bars, a front-page investigation into systemic racism in federal prisons using a database of more than 50,000 inmates obtained via a freedom of information request. Risk assessments, used widely within the prison system, are meant to be an impartial guide of who can be rehabilitated and how soon, but racialized inmates routinely get the worst possible scores. These assessments are steeped in decades of research – but, as The Globe found, they’re also fundamentally, powerfully biased against Indigenous and Black inmates, placing them in higher security classifications and assigning them worse odds of successfully re-entering society. Since Bias Behind Bars was published, the House of Commons' public safety committee has announced a study on systemic racism in correctional risk assessments.
